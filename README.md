## How to Create GitHub Pages

_For example purposes, we will create a GitHub page for user_ `johndoe`.

1. **Create a GitHub repository**  
   The repository's name must be `[username].github.io`, so for this example:  
    `johndoe.github.io`

2. **Using a terminal, clone the repository**  
   Go to the folder where you want to store your project, then clone the newly created repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/johndoe/johndoe.github.io`

3. **Add an** `index.html` **file within your folder**
4. **Stage, commit, and push your changes to the remote repository**
5. **You did it!**  
   You can go to the user website by going to: `https://johndoe.github.io`

## Key Takeaways

My key takeways from this exercise is that web development, even with simple HTML/CSS, can be very difficult, but sometimes you are able to find enjoyment in the work that you do. For me, it was finding joy in simple CSS animations, which I found very amazing :).
